Supporting Material (Appendix).
In this repository, additional files used during my PhD work are provided for the general public and research community.
The g-code used to optimise for Material Extrusion Printing is providedc(g-code.text) as well as the CAD design for a lattice structure and a table highlighting visible light photoinitiators currently available.

The G-Code is written to extrude individual print lines for the Allevi 2 is shown below.
Repetier-Host V2.1.6 is used as the g-code editor.
Each line is defined as A1, A2, A3 etc.. Individual parameters such as print speed can be varied for individual lines. As you move towards B and C, layer height is varied while keeping speeds constant through the numbering system
